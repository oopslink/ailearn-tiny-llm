# Learning Notes

This directory contains concept notes, study materials, and reference information organized by topic.

## 📁 Organization

Organize your notes by:
- **Concepts**: Deep dives into specific concepts (attention, quantization, etc.)
- **Papers**: Notes from reading research papers
- **Comparisons**: Comparing different approaches or implementations
- **Debugging**: Common issues and solutions
- **Resources**: Collected learning resources

## 📝 Suggested Structure

### Example Note Structure

```markdown
# [Concept Name]

## Overview
Brief description of the concept

## Why It Matters
Why this is important for LLM serving

## Key Ideas
- Main points
- Core principles
- Important properties

## Mathematical Details
Formulas and derivations (if applicable)

## Implementation Notes
Practical considerations for implementing

## Common Pitfalls
Things to watch out for

## Resources
- Papers
- Blog posts
- Documentation
```

## 🎯 Tips

- **Write in your own words** - this solidifies understanding
- **Include diagrams** - visual explanations help
- **Link concepts** - connect ideas across notes
- **Date your notes** - track when you learned things
- **Update as you learn** - add insights as you progress

## 🔗 Integration with Sessions

Your session docs (`sessions/`) capture daily work.  
These notes (`notes/`) provide deeper conceptual understanding.

Consider:
- Creating a note after fully understanding a concept
- Referencing notes from session docs
- Updating notes as understanding deepens
- Using notes for review and reinforcement
