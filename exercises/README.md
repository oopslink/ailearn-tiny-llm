# Practice Exercises

This directory contains additional practice exercises, experiments, and explorations beyond the main course.

## 🎯 Purpose

Use this space to:
- Practice concepts from the course
- Experiment with variations
- Try alternative implementations
- Explore related topics
- Build confidence through repetition

## 📁 Organization

Organize exercises by:
- **Week**: Exercises related to each week's topics
- **Concept**: Specific concept practice
- **Experiments**: Exploratory implementations
- **Challenges**: Self-created challenges

## 💡 Exercise Ideas

### Week 1 Exercises
- [ ] Implement different attention variants (local, sparse, linear)
- [ ] Compare positional encoding methods
- [ ] Experiment with different normalization techniques
- [ ] Try different sampling strategies
- [ ] Modify model architecture (depth, width, heads)
- [ ] Implement from a different model (Llama, GPT-2)

### Week 2 Exercises
- [ ] Implement different quantization schemes (INT8, INT4, mixed precision)
- [ ] Compare KV cache strategies
- [ ] Benchmark different kernel implementations
- [ ] Experiment with batching strategies
- [ ] Profile and optimize different components
- [ ] Try different hardware backends

### Week 3 Exercises
- [ ] Build different RAG architectures
- [ ] Implement various agent patterns
- [ ] Experiment with long context techniques
- [ ] Compare paging strategies
- [ ] Build end-to-end applications

## 🧪 Experiment Template

Create experiments using this structure:

```markdown
# Experiment: [Name]

## Hypothesis
What I'm trying to test or understand

## Setup
- Implementation approach
- Test conditions
- Metrics to measure

## Implementation
Code and approach

## Results
What happened

## Analysis
What it means

## Learnings
What I learned from this experiment
```

## 🎓 Learning Through Practice

**Tips**:
1. **Start simple** - basic version first
2. **Measure everything** - quantify results
3. **Compare approaches** - understand trade-offs
4. **Document findings** - capture insights
5. **Iterate** - try variations
6. **Challenge yourself** - gradually increase difficulty

## 🏆 Challenge Ideas

### Beginner Challenges
- Implement attention without looking at reference
- Debug intentionally broken implementations
- Optimize a naive implementation

### Intermediate Challenges
- Build a minimal chatbot
- Implement a paper from scratch
- Create custom optimizations

### Advanced Challenges
- Build a production-ready serving system
- Implement distributed inference
- Create novel optimizations

## 📊 Tracking Progress

Keep track of:
- Exercises completed
- Time spent
- Skills practiced
- Insights gained
- Areas needing more practice

## 🔗 Integration with Main Learning

These exercises **supplement** the main course:
- Do exercises **after** completing related course material
- Use exercises to **reinforce** understanding
- Return to exercises when **reviewing** concepts
- Create exercises to **test** your understanding

## 💭 Reflection

After completing exercises, reflect on:
- What was challenging?
- What did I learn?
- What would I do differently?
- What do I want to explore more?
- How does this connect to other concepts?
