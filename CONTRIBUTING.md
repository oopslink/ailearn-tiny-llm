# Contributing to Tiny-LLM Learning Project

This is a personal learning project, but contributions in the form of improvements, corrections, or suggestions are welcome!

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This repository is designed for **learning** LLM inference and serving systems. Any contributions should support this educational goal.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
If you find errors or have suggestions:
1. Check existing issues first
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Which week/day it relates to
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Your environment (OS, Python version, MLX version)

### Suggesting Improvements
For documentation or structure improvements:
1. Open an issue describing the improvement
2. Explain how it helps the learning experience
3. Provide examples if applicable

### Code Contributions
For code examples or utilities:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Add your contribution
4. Ensure code follows project style
5. Write clear commit messages
6. Submit a pull request

## 📝 Contribution Guidelines

### Documentation
- Use clear, educational language
- Include examples and explanations
- Reference course materials appropriately
- Follow existing documentation structure

### Code
- Add docstrings and comments
- Include shape annotations for tensors
- Follow existing code organization
- Add tests where appropriate
- Keep implementations pedagogical (prefer clarity over cleverness)

### Session Documentation
- Share interesting insights or alternative approaches
