# Contributing to Your Learning

This is a personal learning repository, but here are some guidelines for organizing your work:

## Adding Notes

- Place general notes in `notes/`
- Place chapter-specific notes in the respective `chapters/chXX-*/` directory
- Use clear markdown formatting for readability

## Adding Code

1. Place implementations in the `code/` directory
2. Create subdirectories for different topics
3. Include docstrings and comments
4. Add usage examples in the code or README

## Adding Exercises

1. Place exercises in the `exercises/` directory
2. Include the problem statement
3. Document your solution approach
4. Add test cases where applicable

## Best Practices

- Commit regularly with clear messages
- Update progress checkboxes in the main README
- Document challenges and insights
- Keep code clean and well-organized
- Reference course materials with links

## File Naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `tokenizer-implementation.py`
- Be descriptive: `ch01-hello-world.py` instead of `test.py`
- Include chapter numbers when relevant
